t2 is a simple task-list web application based on the most
excellent "Ruby on Rails Tutorial" by Michael Hartl, available 
at https://www.railstutorial.org/book.

I went through the tutorial, and afterwards hacked it from the
Twitter-like site the tutorial builds into its current form.
I make no promises as to efficiency, correctness, or (most
importantly) security.

For those of you keeping score at home, note that this was 
done with an earlier version of the tutorial.
